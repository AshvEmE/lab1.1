			Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale,
			Thorough flood, thorough fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the
			moon's sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the
			green. The cowslips tall her pensioners be: In their gold coats spots you
			see; Those be rubies, fairy favours, In those freckles live their savours:
			I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
			Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone: Our queen and all our elves
			come here anon.

			The king doth keep his revels here to-night: Take heed the queen come not
			within his sight; For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she
			as her attendant hath A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king; She never
			had so sweet a changeling; And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight
			of his train, to trace the forests wild; But she perforce withholds the
			loved boy, Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy: And now they
			never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear, or spangled starlight
			sheen, But, they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into
			acorn-cups and hide them there.
